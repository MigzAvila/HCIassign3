			At first glance, the demo looks simple and easy to use. Although there weren't any direct instructions, learning 
			how to operate the demo was straightforward. Therefore, playing around with the controls, one can quickly decipher 
			and know how the demo works.

			Unlike the first demo, this demo from Mozilla gave instructions on how to operate it. After reading the instructions, 
			it was clear how to work with the demo. They also included a section where you can see the exact details being implemented 
			on the text, but it would have been a better design if they match that field with the other to show a better structure.
